# pluggage
Python Plugin and Factory utils library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evansde77/pluggage.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/evansde77/pluggage)

Documentation is on [pluggage.readthedocs.org](https://pluggage.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

I have come across needs for this pattern several times, so figured I would take a stab at putting together a library 
to make it general/flexible enough that I never have to write it again. 

Implements some general plugin loader functions as well as a metaclass driven factory and plugin 
registry
